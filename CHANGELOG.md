# Changelog

## [0.0.3] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: `evals/evals.json` — 22 functional evals (137 expectations) covering all documented features: static clone, interactions (hover/click/scroll/auto-timer), responsive sweep, screenshot/video input, multi-section pages, overlay dismissal, SPA loading, Canvas/WebGL branching, JS bundle analysis, CORS fallback, fix protocol, CSS custom properties, @keyframes extraction, resize video, component self-containment, and partial extraction (single-section, hidden-element, multi-section)
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: `evals/trigger-eval.json` — 30 trigger evals (16 true / 14 false)
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: `evals/evals.json` — 17 functional evals (105 expectations) covering all documented features: hover CSS, WAAPI stagger, scroll parallax, Three.js particles, CSS @keyframes, modal spring overshoot, hybrid CSS+Canvas, Rive, Lottie, Spline, multi-line globalCharIndex stagger, scroll reverse direction, fix protocol, capture-frames.sh validation, children cascade, WAAPI recovery, and post-implementation capture
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: `evals/trigger-eval.json` — 25 trigger evals (13 true / 12 false)
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: `measurement.md` — mandatory Step -1: 11-point multi-property measurement pass (hover, page-load, scroll-driven). Reveals multi-phase timing and non-linear curves before implementation
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: `verification.md` — visual verification & bug diagnosis protocol extracted from SKILL.md. Includes scope-specific comparison tables (element vs fullpage), root-cause-first diagnosis protocol, and "Is This Done?" checklist
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: `waapi-scrubbing.md` — WAAPI scrubber injection procedure extracted from SKILL.md. Includes 3-level path fallback (CLAUDE_SKILLS_DIR → git root → ~/.claude/skills)
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: `responsive-detection.md` — Step 4: auto-detect real breakpoints via 2-pass viewport sweep (coarse 40px → fine 5px) instead of hardcoded 375/768/1440. Includes per-breakpoint style extraction, responsive verification (A-R/B-R/C-R), and resize video capture
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: Step 5b (deferred C3 capture) and Step 6b (assemble extracted.json) in SKILL.md pipeline

### Changed
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: SKILL.md restructured — gated step flow (Step -1 → 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4) with explicit gates at each step; principles 6–7 added (measure all properties at multiple points, never assume linearity)
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: css-extraction.md — critical warning now references measurement.md instead of duplicating the rationale
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: SKILL.md — C1+C2 mandatory in Phase 1, C3 deferred to Step 5b (needs interaction data); breakpoints output changed from fixed `375/768/1440` to `{ "detected": [...], "tailwind": {...} }`
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: style-extraction.md — removed orphaned Step 4 section (now a one-line pointer to responsive-detection.md)
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: visual-verification.md — A-C3 explicitly marked as deferred to Step 5b; A-R deferred to Step 4
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: SKILL.md — added "Partial extraction" section with 4 scope types (single-section, multi-section, single-element, hidden-element), per-scope pipeline adjustments, and artifact naming conventions
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: SKILL.md description updated — trigger-oriented phrasing with typical request examples and explicit NOT-trigger conditions
- Eval files placed in per-skill `skills/*/evals/` directories (skill-creator convention)
- `.gitignore` — added `ui-skills-workspace/` for eval run artifacts
- README.md — pipeline diagram updated with Steps 5b/6b, viewport sweep description, transition-RE process overview, and eval coverage section
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` — version bumped to 0.0.3; description updated with viewport sweep and 11-point measurement; added keywords (`breakpoint-detection`, `viewport-sweep`, `visual-verification`, `waapi`)

### Fixed
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: verification.md — removed Phase B/C terminology (belongs to ui-RE, not transition-RE)
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: measurement.md — scroll-driven example replaced overly specific placeholders (`<ring-group-selector>`) with generic pattern + explicit "adapt selectors" guidance
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: waapi-scrubbing.md — SKILL_DIR fallback now searches git root and env var, not just `~/.claude/skills`
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: SKILL.md Reference Files — `visual-verification.md` now listed as "Steps 8–9" (was "Step 8" only)
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: verification.md — SVG `className` now uses `.baseVal` fallback (consistent with dom-extraction.md, interaction-detection.md, css-extraction.md)
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: responsive-detection.md — Pass 1 coarse sweep now checks and re-registers `__responsiveMeasure` if page reloads mid-sweep (previously only Pass 2 had this guard)

## [0.0.2] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: Step 0 — mandatory reference frame capture before classification (SKILL.md)
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: stagger with hidden parent — correct reveal order recipe; DOM restore, parent opacity, React effect cleanup troubleshooting entries (patterns.md)
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: three mandatory capture types (C1 static screenshots, C2 scroll video, C3 transition/interaction video) at 60 fps (visual-verification.md)
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: interaction detection results must be saved to `interactions-detected.json` (interaction-detection.md)
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: Phase A / Phase B gates — validation checks before proceeding to extraction or comparison (visual-verification.md, SKILL.md)

### Changed
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: SKILL.md pipeline diagram now includes Phase 1 (reference capture) with gate checks; sub-document references changed from "see X" to "Read X, execute"
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: visual-verification.md restructured — separate C1/C2/C3 comparison tables replace single frame table; 60 fps replaces 2 fps
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`**: component-generation.md prerequisites now block generation if artifacts are missing

### Fixed
- README.md: typo fix (`no치t` → `not`)
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: css-extraction.md — added missing HTTPS validation for stylesheet download (consistent with other download commands)
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`**: SKILL.md — added selector validation guidance for `window.__scrub.setup()`

## [0.0.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **`ui-reverse-engineering`** — full pipeline skill: URL → DOM/CSS/JS extraction → responsive breakpoints → React + Tailwind component → visual verification
  - URL input: exact values via `getComputedStyle`, DOM inspection, JS bundle analysis
  - Screenshot/video input: accepted as fallback, analyzed via Claude Vision (approximation)
- **`transition-reverse-engineering`** — precise animation extraction sub-skill
  - CSS path (transitions, keyframes) and Canvas/WebGL path (engine detection, bundle grep)
  - WAAPI scrubbing (`waapi-scrub-inject.js` + `capture-frames.sh`) for page-load animations that complete before capture
  - Frame-by-frame visual comparison workflow with named scopes: `element` (cropped to target) and `fullpage` (entire transition window)

### Changed
- `ui-reverse-engineering`: split into focused reference files — `dom-extraction.md`, `style-extraction.md`, `interaction-detection.md`, `component-generation.md`, `visual-verification.md`; `SKILL.md` is now a slim index
- Responsive breakpoints now extracted from actual CSS `@media` rules; fixed values (375/768/1440) are fallback only

### Fixed
- `waapi-scrub-inject.js`: `cancelAll()` now uses `document.getAnimations()` (Chrome 84+/FF 75+/Safari 14+) instead of full DOM walk; `seek()` calls `pause()` before `currentTime` assignment to avoid `InvalidStateError` on finished animations; selector warns when 0 elements matched; default easing changed `ease` → `linear` with extraction note; `onComplete` → `onfinish` in comments
- `capture-frames.sh`: last frame clamped to `TOTAL_MS` to avoid integer-division drift; `seek` eval now an IIFE that checks `__scrub` presence and surfaces JS errors (exit code alone is unreliable); warning added when `frames=1`
- `css-extraction.md`: division-by-zero fixed in easing curve extraction when sampled array has 1 element
- `canvas-webgl-extraction.md`: Lottie detection narrowed from all `.json` to `lottie`/`bodymovin` only; `md5sum || md5` fallback pipes through `awk '{print $1}'` to strip filename suffix on Linux; framework-agnostic chunk patterns added (Nuxt/Vite/Remix)
- `interaction-detection.md`: HTTPS validation added before bundle download; `className` sanitized before storing in `__scrollTransitions`; retrieve eval falls back to `|| []`
- `visual-verification.md`: bare `agent-browser eval "window.scrollTo(0,0)"` → IIFE form; Phase A/B responsive blocks now re-open in a fresh session before viewport change
- `component-generation.md`: `@keyframes` placement covers Next.js App Router, Vite/CRA, Tailwind v3, and Tailwind v4
- `style-extraction.md`: removed over-filtering of `normal`/`auto` values that silently dropped `fontWeight: normal`, `margin: auto`, etc.
- `dom-extraction.md`: depth limit comment added (increase to 6–8 for deep component trees like shadcn/MUI)
- `patterns.md`: `to()` library example replaced with plain WAAPI; troubleshooting updated to `onfinish` + `anim.cancel()`
- `SKILL.md` (transition): install path uses `CLAUDE_SKILLS_DIR` env var; Bug Diagnosis snippet uses proper IIFE with semicolons
